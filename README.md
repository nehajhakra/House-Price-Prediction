🏡 Project Title: House Price Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning
📖 Overview
This project showcases the complete end-to-end implementation of a regression-based machine learning system to predict housing prices using key property features. Leveraging Python’s data science stack, the model provides insights into what influences house pricing and demonstrates proficiency in real-world data handling, model building, evaluation, and storytelling through data.

It is ideal for recruiters or professionals seeking practical applications of ML concepts like regression, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

🧠 Problem Statement
Predicting house prices accurately is a critical task in the real estate sector, enabling buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions. By analyzing features like living space, garage area, overall quality, and neighborhood, we aim to build a robust machine learning model that can forecast the selling price of a house.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Load, clean, and preprocess a real-world housing dataset

✅ Explore feature relationships through statistical summaries and visualizations

✅ Apply regression algorithms (Linear & Random Forest)

✅ Compare model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

✅ Visualize results to enhance model interpretability

✅ Demonstrate core concepts of supervised learning

🧰 Tech Stack Used
Category	Tools / Libraries
Language	Python
Data Handling	Pandas, NumPy
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn
ML Models	scikit-learn (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor)
Encoding	LabelEncoder
Evaluation	RMSE, MAE, R² Score
Notebook	Jupyter

📊 Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Format: .xlsx with 500 records and 10 columns

Target Variable: SalePrice

Key Features: LotArea, GrLivArea, GarageArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, HalfBath, YearBuilt, OverallQual, and Neighborhood

📌 Project Workflow
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
Verified dataset structure and types

Ensured no missing values

Encoded categorical feature (Neighborhood) using LabelEncoder

2. Feature Engineering
Selected relevant features for regression modeling

Normalized features where needed

Converted categorical to numerical for model compatibility

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated:

📌 Correlation heatmap to identify strong predictors of price

📈 Scatter plots between GrLivArea, GarageArea, and SalePrice

📦 Boxplots of OverallQual vs SalePrice

4. Model Building
Used two supervised learning algorithms:

🔹 Linear Regression

🔸 Random Forest Regressor

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated with:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Model	R² Score	MAE	RMSE
Linear Regression	-0.049	86,483 ₹	100,146 ₹
Random Forest	-0.307	95,495 ₹	111,782 ₹

⚠️ Note: Performance is limited due to small synthetic sample (500 rows). Results will improve with hyperparameter tuning and richer datasets.

6. Visualization of Predictions
📉 Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices

📊 Visualized residuals to assess prediction spread
